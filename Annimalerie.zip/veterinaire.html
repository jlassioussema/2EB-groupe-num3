    <br><img src="vaccination.webp" alt="image de vaccin du chien et chat"/></br>
    <br><p>Vaccination protects your young companion from the most dangerous infectious diseases. In puppies, vaccination starts at 6 weeks and concerns the following diseases: parvovirus, leptospirosis, Rubarth's hepatitis, distemper and kennel cough. In the kitten, vaccination starts at the age of 8 weeks and will protect it from typhus and ducoryza. Vaccination against rabies is compulsory and annual in Tunisia. It must be done at the age of 3 months in dogs and cats. Vaccinating them against rabies will protect them and you in the event of scratches and bites. Vaccination is the best opportunity to discuss your pet's diet, cleanliness and pest control treatments. It is also an opportunity to prepare a health record. This will represent the proof that your animal is correctly vaccinated and you will be asked for it at each visit. </p></br>

<br><p1><strong>sterilization :</strong></p1></br>
    <br><img src="téléchargement.jpg" alt="chat en opération" /></br>
    <br><p>The purpose of sterilization of dogs and cats is to eliminate the sexual behaviors that cause several inconveniences. In males, castration (= removal of the testicles) reduces nocturnal vocalizations, fights and strong-smelling urine marking. In females, oophorectomy (= removal of the ovaries) prevents unwanted heat and litters. In males and females, sterilization considerably reduces the risk of running away and prevents sexually transmitted diseases as well as certain tumors. Sterilization is possible from the age of 6 months in dogs and cats, male and female. Its benefits are more remarkable when it is practiced before puberty. Do not hesitate to ask us for more information about this common practice highly recommended by our veterinarians. </p></br>

<br><p1><strong>surgery :</strong></p1></br>
    <br><img src="vet-holding-kitten-circle.webp" alt="chirurgie dun chien" /></br>
    <br><p>Once the diagnosis of certain surgical conditions has been established with certainty, we perform all kinds of reconstructive surgery: wound sutures, hernia repair, eye surgery, auricular surgery, digestive surgery, urogenital surgery, tumor removal, amputations. Any surgical procedure is preceded by a meticulous examination of the animal in order to minimize the risks associated with general anesthesia as much as possible. We attach great importance to pain management during surgery and after waking the animal. The animals are kept under surveillance during the recovery phase, which can last a few hours. Some surgeries require the animal to be hospitalized for a few days in order to monitor its recovery. The post-operative period being a decisive step in the success of any surgery, our veterinarians will be at your disposal to help you manage your convalescent animal properly.</p></br>

    <br><img src="analyse-lvd1.jpg" alt="laboratoire vétérinaire" /></br>
    <br><p>Equipped with diagnostic kits, a microscope and a centrifuge, we have the necessary equipment to establish a rapid diagnosis. We outsource hematological and biochemical tests to a private laboratory that meets our needs as quickly as possible and according to the same high standards as in human medicine. For serological tests, we only use approved laboratories. While waiting to develop our own radiology unit, we are currently collaborating with reliable and serious radiology centers that quickly provide us with very good quality x-ray images.</p></br>

<br><p1><strong>Microchip implantation :</strong></p1></br>
    <br><img src="Microchip-injected-in-dog.jpg" alt="puce éléctronique pour chien" /></br>
    <br><p>The microchip is a small electronic implant the size of a grain of rice that is injected under the skin of an animal. The chip contains a unique number to which information about the animal and its owner is linked. The microchip is mandatory for animals that travel. It is also very interesting if your pet is lost or stolen. Indeed, thanks to the identification number, the chip makes it possible to find or prove who is the master. On the other hand, if they are not equipped with an electronic chip, found or lost animals have very little chance of finding their owner. The electronic chip is a benign and quick act. Our veterinarians will be happy to do this for your dog or cat and provide you with their electronic identification certificate.</p></br>
